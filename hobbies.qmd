## Hiking

I like to hike with my dog, Bubs, around Colorado. I am pretty good at hiking and have been doing it since I was a kid. I like it because it is peaceful and a good workout.

## Video Games

I like to play video games. My favorite is Stardew Valley but I also like playing Valorant and Hades. I am okay at video games but I just play them for fun so I don't try too hard. I like it because it allows me to go on adventures without leaving the comfort of my homes.

## Nail Art

I like to use gel nail polish to create cute designs on my own nails. I'm not that good at it yet but I am getting better. I like it because it makes my nails look beautiful and it helps me to relax.
